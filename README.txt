Word Count Project Questions

1. Kaleb Bello and Alexis Lozano

2. The project took 4 weeks to complete. 

3. Before starting we believed the Binary Search Tree would be the fastest because the structure is already sorted so 
	going through and finding the amount of times a number appears or anaylyzing the amount of unique words shouldn't take a long time. 

4. After running some tests, the AVL Tree seems to work the fastest. AVL is faster because the tree can rebalance itself allowing new insertions to sort
	on their own. Otherwise a BST, needs more time to balance, sort, and insert. 

5. For this repsonse, better is defined by the ease of coding and creating the class. In this case, creating the AVL tree was better. Since the BST class
	was already created for us, we were able to refer to the BST to create the AVL. It's hard sometimes to create a data structure from scratch especially
	for an assignment of this difficulty, so having the BST class as a reference made the process smooth. As far as the logic of the code itself, AVL still
	tops the BST and Hash Table. AVL worked the fastest, and debugging was a breeze - again with the help of the completed BST. Although more memory was 
	used in AVL becuase of the self balancing, AVL had a better rate of completion. 
  
6. When using the Correlator there are various cases when the data structure performs better than others. For example the Correlator set to use a BST reveals the 
	real time is 0m0.404ms while the user time is 0m1.055s. This case shows how user time is delayed. We find this is the case for the AVL and Hash Table
	as well. The AVL data structure outputs the following times -  real: 0m0.428s - user: 0m1.036s - sys: 0m0.093s. Hash table outputs the following times
	real: 0m0.409s - user: 0m1.041s - sys: 0m0.085s.
   From the data collected we see, user time is significantly slower than real and system times in the Correlator. 

7. Analyzing data from "Hamlet" and "The New Atlantis", Bacon did not write plays/sonnets credited by Shakespear. The first piece of evidence is the amount of words
	in each document - "Hamlet" holds more words than "The New Atlantis" - a sign that story telling was more elaborate. Second when running the frequency
	the amount of certain words repetedly getting used are different. For "The New Atlantis", the top words are simplistic and don't hint at similar writing
	diction that's found in Shakespear's work. The words are quite futuristic for the times. Meanwhile in "Hamlet", the top frequency of words are difficult 
	for today's writings. The words are dated such as - "shall", "thou", "exeunt", all words that wouldn't be used today. Just by the data and running the
	frequency test and finding the amount of unique words, the counts aren't close. If they were, it would be an easier conclusion to say the documents were written by the 
	same person. 
  Overall, each author wrote their own pieces of work. Shakespear has a history of having is own defined diction that's widely known. He uses "thou" various times
	and his sonnet's and plays live within the time they are written. Unlike "Hamlet", "The New Atlantis" is a shorter story with its rheotric seeming to be futuristic. The words 
	aren't strenuous and can still be interpretted today with less hesistation. With that, the conclusion is that both Bacon and Shakespear wrote their own pieces of work.

8. The assignment was a challenge without a doubt, but in the end the hard work paid off. The enjoyable part of the project was working with template code
	and having extended time to complete the assignment. The hardest aspect was identifying where certain code connected and the relationship it had to 
	other methods or classes. The instructions were in depth but confusing as to what exactly is needed. Otherwise the project was a great challenge.
